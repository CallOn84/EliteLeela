# Leela Chess Zero & Derived Nets
This repository contains all the nets that I have trained. This included Leela Chess Zero nets and any Lc0-derived nets, like Maia. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. Otherwise, you can download any nets here and play or test yourself.

# EliteLeela
Elite Leela is a project derived from Leela Chess Zero, where Leela was trained using the 19.7 million games from the Lichess Elite Database created by nikonoel from Lichess.
