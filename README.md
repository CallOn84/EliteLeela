# EliteLeela
Elite Leela is a project derived from Leela Chess Zero, where Leela was trained using the 19.7 million games from the Lichess Elite Database created by nikonoel from Lichess.

This repository is where all the nets are stored, so if you want to try it out yourself, you can download it from here.
